  This is an image classification project I completed to familiarize myself with AWS Sagemaker and TensorFlow Image Classification based of a Coursera course. This project trains a neural net model on a database of cats and dogs to distinguish images of the two animals and their various breeds. All the steps and setup are within the Jupyter Notebook file. The following steps are performed within this project: data aquisition, data preprocessing, model creation, model training, model deployment.
