</h3>

  <p align="center">
  This is an image classification project I completed to familiarize myself with AWS Sagemaker and TensorFlow Image Classification based of a Coursera course. This project trains a neural net model on a database of cats and dogs to distinguish images of the two animals and their various breeds. All the steps and setup are within the Jupyter Notebook file.
